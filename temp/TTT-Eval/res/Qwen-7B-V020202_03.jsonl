The question is: Chalktown High School had their prom last weekend. There were 123 Students who attended. If 3 Students attended on their own, how many couples came to the prom? \n Student: Let's call the number of couples that attended the prom \"c\". \n\nWe know that there were 123 Students total, and that 3 of them attended on their own. This means that the rest of the Students attended as couples. \n\nSo we can set up the equation: \n\ncouples + 3 = 123 \n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides: \n\ncouples = 120 \n\nSo there were 120 couples that attended the prom. \n\n 120 \n Tutor: could you please walk me through your solution? \n Student: Sure. I started by setting up an equation. I knew that there were 123 Students total and that 3 of them attended on their own so I set up the equation: couples + 3 = 123. Then I subtracted 3 from both sides of the equation to get couples = 120. So that means there were 120 couples that attended the prom. \n Tutor: jian are you sure that if you subtract the 3 people who attended on their own from the 123 total Students then do you get the number of couples? \n Student: Yes that is correct. If there were 123 Students total and 3 of them attended on their own then the remaining 120 Students must have attended in couples. \n Tutor: that is correct. but how many couples were there isn't that the question/ \n Student: Yes that is the question. So if there were 123 Students total and 3 of them attended on their own then the remaining 120 Students must have attended in couples. Therefore there were 120 couples that attended the prom. \n Tutor: a couple means  a pair or you can say two people together as a unit. \n Student: Yes that is correct.
