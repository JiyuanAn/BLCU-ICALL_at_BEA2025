{"conversation_id": "221-362eb11a-f190-42a6-b2a4-985fafdcfa9e", "conversation_history": "Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people? \n Student: To serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.\nEach sandwich requires 1+1 = 2 pounds of meat and cheese.\nFor 5 sandwiches, he needs a total of 2 x 5 = 10 pounds of meat and cheese.\nThe cost of 10 pounds of meat is 10 x $7.00 = $70.\nThe cost of 10 pounds of cheese is 10 x $3.00 = $30.\nThe total cost of meat and cheese is $70 + $30 = $100.\n 100 \n Tutor: How many pounds of meat are needed for each sandwich? \n Student: Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. \n Tutor: What is the cost of 1 pound of meat? \n Student: The cost of 1 pound of meat is $7.00.", "tutor_responses": {"Sonnet": {"response": "Great, you've correctly identified the cost of the meat, now let's focus on calculating the total cost of meat for all the sandwiches needed.", "annotation": {"Mistake_Identification": "Yes", "Mistake_Location": "Yes", "Providing_Guidance": "Yes", "Actionability": "Yes"}, "annotation_pred": {"providing_guidance": {"response": "Feedback: The tutor's response is somewhat incomplete as it directs the student to the point of their error without providing a hint or explanation to help them correct their calculation.
